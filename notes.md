# Database setup

(Using *pinsanity.com* as a potential domain name...might not be available)

## Master list
This contains all pin information...not alterable by users
/get - pinsanity.com/

## User
Need to learn more about authentication, but will have an id

## List
This has 3 columns: id, listName, fUserID


## ListContents
This has 3 columns: id, fPinID, fListID

A user can create a list and give it a name, then select pins from the master list to add to their custom list


# Routes needed
## /get
* pinsanity.com - Display master list
* pinsanity.com/pinID - Display information about a pin
